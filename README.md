# RL-tabular-solution-methods
This repo contains the code of RL algorithms in tabular case.

## Dependencies
This code requires the following:
* python 3.7.6

## Experimental Tasks
We implement the tabular RL algorithms in discrete 2D maze navigation tasks, e.g. a simple maze navigation problem is shown as follow:
